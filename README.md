# SeveranceStrategyURP
 
Severance Strategy - my first major strategy game, doing its way to Steam store.
I using this one just to improve my coding skills, as every coding session over this project ends up with me learing something new, in particulary now - from async programming and multithreading.

Global game concept still on brainstorm stage, so there's nothing I really want to say anyone about it, my apologies.
