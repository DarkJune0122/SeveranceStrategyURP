QuitCodes:{
	1 - When game starts, Main mod load scripts cannot exit without error. Try reinstall your game or check console for more info (also you can report about this in my discord: DarkJune#0122).
	2 - When game starts, ModObjectLoader can't exit without error. Maybe, your mod can have some issues.


}

[EDIT] - mark for code, that must be changed ehrn it's avable, because now it's work by only one way.
[FINAL] - Need to be changed after all development. Application quit cases - large part of all this final changes.
[OLD] - Old parts of code, that was marked as [Edit] before some edits.

## Texture region:
Shields: Have a sprite for every size. like, "Standart_ShieldTexture_" + 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 (as string)
	If any texture found - finding by name "Standart_ShieldTexture_Default"
	Shields, like 1x3, 5x9, 999x999, supported, but game doesn't have texture for this (game will use standart shield texture for this situation)

## Task region: (Now replaced with Naninovel)
Task format (first argument - task name, all next - additional arguments):
	Wait(float Time)
	Jump(int TaskID) // Use carefully! If anywhere after point, in that you jump, you have ANY task with unit,
		all this tasks must have #(mark for skippable task), to prevent some problems
	TriggerNext(Vector2 position, Vector2 colliderSize, bool innerCollider)
	TriggerNext(Vector2 position, Vector2 colliderSize, bool innerCollider, @ID) // Wait until Unit enter or out of collider
	TriggerNext(Vector2 position, Vector2 colliderSize, bool innerCollider, @ID) // Wait until Unit enter or out of collider
	ObjectiveKill(@ID)
	
	InitDialog(string fileName, bool interact)
	@Go
	@Hide
	@Show
	@Minimize
	@Maximize
